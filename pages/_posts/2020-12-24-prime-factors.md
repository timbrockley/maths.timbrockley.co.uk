## What are Prime Factors ?
Prime factors are factors of a number that are, themselves, prime numbers.

`2 and 3 are prime factors of 12.`

## What is a Prime Factor Tree ?
A prime factor tree is a visual aid used to find the prime factors of a number. The prime factors of 60 are 2, 3 and 5.

## Expressing a Number as a Product of it's Prime Factors
A number can be written down or expressed as product of it's prime factors by multiplying them together.

In the above examples, the number 2 appears twice so it's used twice as follows.

`2 x 2 x 3 x 5` = `2^2 x 3 x 5` = `60`

## Index Form
Index form is a way of expressing a number that is multiplied by itself.

The ^ symbol is used to represent a number's index value as follows.

`2 x 2 x 2 = 2^3`

It can also be written as smaller number next to the number being multiplied.

2<sup>3</sup>

`Other terms for Index include Exponent and Power.`
